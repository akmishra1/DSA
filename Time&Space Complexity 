Time Complexity
Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a 
function of the length of the input. 
 
Space complexity 
Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm
 to run as a function of the length of the input.
